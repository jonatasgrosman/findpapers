This grammar knowledge database can be applied for learners of Japanese as a second language (JSL) to study the Japanese sentence patterns for Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT). Selection of Example sentence is a challenging problem when constructing the database, because it is difficult to detect the Japanese sentence patterns from the example sentences. To solve this problem, NLP and machine learning technologies are applied to automatically detect the Japanese sentence patterns from the input example sentences by proposing an approach which integrates Conditional Random Fields (CRF) machine learning algorithm and manual rules. Several experiments were conducted and the experimental results demonstrated the validity of the proposed methods by using NLP and machine learning techniques on the design and construction of the Japanese grammar knowledge database. This database can be considered as an effective supplementary tool for learning Japanese grammar, and as a further improvement in the effectiveness of current intelligent computer-aided Japanese language learning system.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) causes significant impairments in memory and other cognitive domains. As there is no cure to the disease yet, early detection and delay of disease progression are critical for management of AD. Verbal fluency is one of the most common and sensitive neuropsychological methods used for detection and evaluation of the cognitive declines in AD, in which a subject is required to name as many items as possible in 30 or 60 seconds that belong to a certain category. In this study, we develop an approach to detect AD using a verb fluency (VF) task, a specific subset of verbal fluency analyzing the subjects\u2019 listing of verbs in a given time period. We use machine learning techniques including random forest (RF), neural network (NN), recurrent NN (RNN), and natural language processing (NLP) to detect the risk of AD. The results show that the developed models can stratify subjects into the corresponding AD and control groups with up to 76% accuracy using RF, but at a cost of having to preprocess the data. This accuracy is slightly lower, but not significantly, at 67% using RNN and NLP, which involves almost no manual preprocessing of the data. This study opens up a powerful approach of using simple VF tasks for early detection of AD.",

      "abstract": "Natural language (neural network) is composed of a large number of human visual systems. Its research began with artificial perception and is used to describe things or phenomena involved in the process of human brain processing external information. At the same time, neural network is a nonlinear system description and analysis method. It is mainly used in manual calculation, pattern recognition and so on. Therefore, this paper studies natural language processing based on convolutional neural network and semi supervised algorithm in deep learning. Firstly, this paper expounds the definition of natural language processing, then studies the application of convolutional neural network and semi supervised algorithm, and tests the feature recognition of word vector in natural language to show the optimization results of deep learning algorithm. The test results show that the effect of word vector merging is relatively high. In the optimization process of convolutional neural network, after adding standard interval for semi supervised learning, the accuracy of prediction results also increases significantly, and with the increase of the number of labels, the accuracy also increases gradually.",

With the increase in computation power, deep learning models are being used for various NLP tasks. Further availability of large datasets of various languages enables the training of deep learning models. Multiple processing layers are used by the deep learning methods for learning representations of data which are hierarchical in nature and which gives excellent results for different NLP tasks. This paper reviews the important models and methods in deep learning which are applied to natural language problems. In particular, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit, Recursive Neural Network have been described. Also, their advantages and suitability to various natural language processing applications such as text classification, sentiment analysis, etc. have been reviewed.",

      "abstract": "The widespread use of electronic health records (EHR) systems in health care provides a large amount of real-world data, leading to new areas for clinical research. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been used as an artificial intelligence strategy to extract information from clinical narratives in electronic health records since they include a great amount of valuable clinical information. However, in a free-form text such as electronic health records, many clinical data are still hidden in a clinical narrative format. Therefore, the performance of biomedical NLP techniques is required to unlock the full potential of EHR data to convert a clinical narrative text automatically into structured clinical data. In this way, biomedical NLP applications can be used to direct clinical decisions, identify medical problems, and effectively postpone or avoid the occurrence of a disease. This review discusses the current literature on the secondary use of electronic health record data for clinical research on chronic diseases and addresses the potential, challenges, and applications of biomedical NLP techniques. We review some of the biomedical NLP methods and systems used over EHRs and give an overview of machine learning and deep learning methodologies used to process EHRs and improve the understanding of the patient\u2019s clinical records and the prediction of chronic diseases risk, providing a great chance to extract previously unknown clinical information. Moreover, this review summarizes the utilizing of Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques in biomedical NLP tasks based on chronic diseases related EHR data. Finally, this review presents the future trends and challenges in the biomedical NLP.",

The results show the efficacy of the NLPIDS by producing better F1-score (0.999) and negligible false alarms (0.007) compared to existing methods. The NLPIDS does not depend on attack methods and feature vectors.",

The recommended NLP pipeline composition has well-defined procedures. The implemented message broker design is a usual apparatus for delivering events. It makes it achievable to construct a robust training dataset for machine learning use-case and serve the model's input. The reconstructed dataset is a valid input for the machine learning processes.

This has led to the development of a plethora of NLP resources. However, several obstacles stand in the way of creating reliable NLP systems that can process natural languages effectively and efficiently. Part of speech (POS) tagging is one such technology;it assigns labels to sentences or phrases inside a paragraph based on where they appear. Researchers have made great strides in POS tagging, but there is always room for improvement, especially in decreasing false positives and correctly categorizing new words. It's also important to remember that there is sure to be some confusion if you tag phrases with manypossible interpretations depending on the surrounding material. In order to effectively identify words in a particular phrase across a paragraph, POS taggers based on \u201cdeep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML)\u201d have recently been deployed as viable solutions.",

Given the multiplicity of websites on the Internet and the spread of social networking services like Twitter, for example, it is stated that about 6000 tweets are posted per second in the year 2019. This work aims to analyze these texts through resorting to artificial intelligence to help solve this problem. In this article, a review is presented on the latest concepts in the field of word processing, information extraction, and implementing an interface for text analysis using the C++ programming language and Visual Studio 2015 edition. A comparison is made between two articles in terms of the number of verbs, prepositions, article strength, number of letters, with the possibility of sorting the text into verbs, nouns, object, and adjectives, as will be displayed in the program interface.",

Therefore there is a need for tools that will help to overcome the problem of management and handling the Big Data in a quick manner. The primary goal of this work is to propose an efficient method for automatic text summarization by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This research introduces an abrupt, easily understandable and uncomplicated implementation of this method via overusing Python programming language. Efficient performance is necessary in web search tasks where an enormous of unstructured data need to be summarized very quickly. The novelty of the work is that text summarization is implemented on Kazakh texts. Extractive summarization uses new, keywords focused, approach. Contribution of the work is manually created stop words used for text summarization specifically for Kazakh language and dataset constructed by scraping news from country's largest international news portal www.inform.kz. State-of-the-art results of the work show that it is possible to implement automatic text summarization for Kazakh language.",

Recent advances in artificial intelligence and communication technology have considerably enhanced natural language processing applications. Due to improvements in deep learning, virtually every aspect of artificial intelligence, including natural language processing, has made substantial progress. Deep learning methods use many layers of neurons to construct a neural network. Recurrent Neural Networks and their variants like long short term (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, are some of the most popular deep learning techniques. This article reviews deep learning techniques employed in NLP- specific approaches in the last few years. We also studied the issues faced by researchers while trying to apply deep learning to Asian languages. We also highlight some critical deep learning research work carried out recently for Indian and other Asian languages. In addition, we discuss fundamental linguistic processing challenges and suggest future scopes for the topic.",

The features are used to train Machine Learning algorithms (Neural Network, Random Forest and SVM) to perform classification of social engineering attacks. The classification algorithms showed an accuracy over 80% to detect this type of attacks.",

      "abstract": "The rise of social media has brought the rise of fake news and this fake news comes with negative consequences. With fake news being such a huge issue, efforts should be made to identify any forms of fake news however it is not so simple. Manually identifying fake news can be extremely subjective as determining the accuracy of the information in a story is complex and difficult to perform, even for experts. On the other hand, an automated solution would require a good understanding of NLP which is also complex and may have difficulties producing an accurate output. Therefore, the main problem focused on this project is the viability of developing a system that can effectively and accurately detect and identify fake news. Finding a solution would be a significant benefit to the media industry, particularly the social media industry as this is where a large proportion of fake news is published and spread. In order to find a solution to this problem, this project proposed the development of a fake news identification system using deep learning and natural language processing. The system was developed using a Word2vec model combined with a Long Short-Term Memory model in order to showcase the compatibility of the two models in a whole system. This system was trained and tested using two different dataset collections that each consisted of one real news dataset and one fake news dataset. Furthermore, three independent variables were chosen which were the number of training cycles, data diversity and vector size to analyze the relationship between these variables and the accuracy levels of the system. It was found that these three variables did have a significant effect on the accuracy of the system. From this, the system was then trained and tested with the optimal variables and was able to achieve the minimum expected accuracy level of 90%. The achieving of this accuracy levels confirms the compatibility of the LSTM and Word2vec model and their capability to be synergized into a single system that is able to identify fake news with a high level of accuracy.",

The new found excitement in these fields of research is the availability of high powered computing devices at a cheaper costs and the wide range of applications of these research fields. It can be safely said that in the present times there are hardly any sectors of businesses which have not been positively impacted by artificial intelligence or its subfields. Machine learning and deep learning, apart from having a positive impact on different sectors of businesses, machine learning and deep learning have also played a very important role in improving the efficiency of other subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision and natural language processing. Natural Language Processing is the ability of computer systems to understand human languages, which is a difficult task where these learning techniques has played a very important role in proper analysis. The paper proposes to highlight this important role played by the learning techniques in improving the efficiency of natural language processing.",

We propose a statistical analysis of papers published from 2012 to 2015 in the main ACL conferences. Our aim is investigating which DL term, and consequently which DL method, is mostly used for each specific NLP task, since its introduction in the field. In order to do this, our first contribution is the development of two terminological lists, referring respectively to DL methods for text analysis and NLP tasks. The list of deep learning terms contains 41 terms and acronyms, as well as a NLP term list contains 145 terms and acronyms. From our corpus, the frequencies of various terms have been extracted with respect to the ACL conference and the publication year. After the preliminary data analysis, we decided to restrict the extraction process to abstract texts. We applied multivariate techniques called correspondence analysis in order to visualize and evaluate the joint behavior of our variables.",

      "abstract": "Social media apps have become very promising and omnipresent in daily life. Most social media apps are used to deliver vital information to those nearby and far away. As our lives become more hectic, many of us strive to limit our usage of social media apps because they are too addictive, and the majority of us have gotten preoccupied with our daily lives. Because of this, we frequently overlook crucial information, such as invitations to weddings, interviews, birthday parties, etc, or find ourselves unable to attend the event. In most cases, this happens because users are more likely to discover the invitation or information only before the event, giving them little time to prepare. To solve this issue, in this study, we created a system that will collect Social media chat and filter it using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods like Tokenization, Stop Words Removal, Lemmatization, Segmentation, and Named Entity Recognition (NER). Also, Machine Learning Algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Algorithm are implemented to prioritize the received invitation and to sort the level of priority. Finally, a customized notification will be delivered to the users where they acknowledge the upcoming event. So the chances of missing the event are less or can be planned.",

      "abstract": "In the era of big data where data consist of images, text, audio etc., manually analysing text is a big challenge. Over a long time, research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has relied upon rule based approach and machine learning approach but these approaches need domain expert to build only task specific NLP systems. However, the recent research in NLP has given rise to pre-trained language models like ELMo, GPT, BERT, DistilBERT etc. which have made transfer learning as state-of-the-art technique in NLP. In this paper, we present the comparison of transfer learning and traditional machine learning approach for text classification. To achieve our goal, we have fine-tuned BERT and DistilBERT for text classification to compare transfer learning approach against the traditional machine learning approach based on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm for feature extraction. The performance of all models is empirically tested on suite of different datasets. The results obtained by fine-tuning pre-trained language models show significant improvement over traditional machine learning approach for text classification. This research study also promotes the use of DistilBERT over BERT as default transfer learning model for various text classification applications because it can be trained in less time with less number of parameters to give similar performance like BERT.",

The inputs for the machine could be text, audio, video, image, and speech. NLP is emerging globally and is being used in many applications. One popular application of NLP is Siri introduced in Apple Inc. This created a greater impact on iPhone community. Machines being trained with respect to voice search will facilitate the future generation in performing day-to-day activities. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have contributed extensively for building this popular framework. The paper aims to provide an NLP solution to a text classification problem and solve it using NLP and machine learning to get the best results and the best accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Fake news spreads like a wildfire and this is a big issue in this era. The Online world contains lots of fake news from various sources and channels by political parties, influential peoples, and bots. People are not good for easily able to distinguish fake news from real one. This will negatively impact people's lives, society, and the world. To maintain stability from the harm done by fake news, we will tackle the topic of fake news detection. we are investigating the effectiveness of machine learning technologies and also introducing a deep learning model for fake news detection with better accuracy. We are using Natural language processing with the above technologies for our purpose. In investigating the effectiveness of machine learning technologies, we had applied various classification algorithms on our data processed by NLP to obtain their accuracy for the problem. Then using new emerging technologies like deep learning, we are proposing solutions with better accuracy. In the machine learning technologies for fake news detection, we have found that AdaBoost classifier, Gradient boosting classifier, and Logistic regression are better in terms of accuracy than other classifiers like decision tree, KNeighbors classifier, Random Forest classifier, and MultinomialNB. But These technologies are more prone to error when a different category of data comes. Deep learning technology used here is the Long short-term memory deep learning model which gave us an accuracy of more than 0.993 and the Bi-directional LSTM model with accuracy near 0.99 taking more time in training than the LSTM model. Through this research, we conclude that machine learning technologies perform worse than deep learning technologies. And proposed LSTM model is better than the Bi-directional LSTM model for fake news detection.",

Banana leaf diseases are becoming one of the most important factors affecting agricultural products. As a result of these diseases, the quantity and quality of agricultural produce have drastically decreased. Hence, early detection and classification of banana leaf diseases are becoming more important than ever. But the ancient method of disease identification, visual observation is no longer helpful in this matter as it requires significant knowledge and experience related to banana diseases and symptoms which present farmers severely lacks. Therefore, using ICT-based approaches such as autoML, deep learning, natural language processing and APIs are very important towards the efficiency of the disease identification process and the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as keeping farmers synced with the information related to their plantation such as recent threats and nearby threats.",

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fast-growing area of study that stretching its presence to many business and research domains. Machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) are subsets of AI to tackle different areas of data processing and modelling. This review article presents an overview of AI\u2019s impact on education outlining with current opportunities. In the education domain, student feedback data is crucial to uncover the merits and demerits of existing services provided to students. AI can assist in identifying the areas of improvement in educational infrastructure, learning management systems, teaching practices and study environment. NLP techniques play a vital role in analyzing student feedback in textual format. This research focuses on existing NLP methodologies and applications that could be adapted to educational domain applications like sentiment annotations, entity annotations, text summarization, and topic modelling. Trends and challenges in adopting NLP in education were reviewed and explored. Context-based challenges in NLP like sarcasm, domain-specific language, ambiguity, and aspect-based sentiment analysis are explained with existing methodologies to overcome them. Research community approaches to extract the semantic meaning of emoticons and special characters in feedback which conveys user opinion and challenges in adopting NLP in education are explored.",

This problem is supplemented by the existence of Electronic Health Records (EHR), which are essentially digital files regarding the patient. However, the length and content of each document vary greatly, reducing the effectiveness. Therefore, this research aims to reduce the need for medical professionals to manually search for crucial information about the patient's health history. We intend to accomplish our objective using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to break down digital documents into smaller subtasks, such as event extraction and abstractive summarization, to provide a concise summary. Our proposed system intends to streamline the process and nullify the issue of having to read lengthy documents to locate essential information, which can affect the overall efficiency and quality of the patient's care. In the future, we intend to migrate to a closed-domain event extraction model and implement a timeline for easier visualization.",

Sentiment analysis is an ongoing research field in knowledge extraction that faces many challenges. In this paper, different machine learning, neural networks, deep learning models were evaluated over the IMDB benchmark dataset for movies reviews. Moreover, various word-embedding techniques were tested. Among all the presented models, the results of this work showed that the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) embeddings has achieved the highest results with an accuracy of 93%.",

In this emerging type of advertising, Natural language processing (NLP) is a powerful tool for intelligently targeting and placing advertisements at the right time and in the right place for the right audience in a very short period. This study systematically reviewed journal articles, book chapters, and conference proceedings for the last ten years to find out what are the uses, approaches, and challenges that the researchers have been recently facing in making use of natural language processing techniques in the domain of advertising. It is found that in the majority of studies, information extraction and sentiment analysis are still the main focus areas. Only a small number of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as deep learning and speech synthesis, are used. In addition, most of the studies are based on traditional forms of advertising (such as search engines, websites, and job listings), excluding the newer forms of mobile and app-based advertising. The ongoing challenge in the current literature is applying natural language processing to automatically target advertisements.",

POS tagging for Indian Languages is not widely explored. Kannada is extremely inflectional and contains one of the most complex and richest collections of linguistic traits. Hence, developing a POS tagger for a resource-poor language such as Kannada is difficult The morphological complexity of Hindi becomes a challenge despite there having been numerous attempts of building a POS tagger for the language. The proposed work deals with the development of a POS tagger for both Kannada and Hindi by employing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. The results obtained are based on experiments conducted on a corpus consisting of around 3 lakh unique words for Kannada and Hindi combined. The 17 POS tags have been taken from the BIS tag set.",

With the present situation of social media platforms, users are developing and sharing more information when compared to the last five years, some of them are not even related to real life. Classifying the text automatically is a tedious and tough job to do. To give a verdict on the truthfulness of an article, a professional too needs to explore multiple aspects of the domain first. Machine learning algorithms are popularly being used to detect the truthfulness of a piece of text. In present scenario, different performance metrics are used to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms. The study examines various textual properties that can be utilized to differentiate the fake and real news. Natural Language Processing techniques are used for data pre-processing which increases the accuracy of the machine learning models. Further, the extracted and preprocessed properties are used to train various ML classifiers with all possible combinations and the built models are then evaluated using various performance metrics.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we have created a Machine Learning Model for Machine Languages, this field of processing machine language and converting/ making meaningful iterations out of it comes under Natural Language Processing. Existing approaches on NLP were focused on human-to-human interactions i.e., English to French, German, Hindi. In this research we try to analyze lexical in machine code, break it down to smaller meaningful bits and make some inferences like the type of languages, number of loops, functionality, and time complexity of code, rewriting of code, converting code from one language to another. We have mainly focused on the recognition of the type of language by testing a small snippet of code. We have also focused on a bigger real-world problem which is conversion of code from one language to another with the same basic meaning and logic, just changing the syntax. We have deployed the machine learning model for public use, and open-sourced Flask API is deployed on the cloud for usage that accepts 3 types of machine languages and returns the type of syntax. We have created a simple Angular App for the demonstration and testing of the model which is hosted and is live online. link (https://nlpapp-8e2fd.web.app/)",

Currently, there is an increasing number of articles and journals flooded on the Internet It is hard to read and study au the related articles to users' research areas manually because there is limited time for each people. One of the solutions is to summarize texts in the article. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the features in Machine Learning (ML) and it is used for summarization This study was tried to investigate the performances of the three different extractive algorithms from NLP. The results were evaluated with the ROUGE evaluation package using ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and ROUGE-SU4 methods. 3 $\\theta$ samples from the BBC dataset were used as the training data in the evaluation process. Results generated from ROUGE toolkit show the performance of the Barrios et al.'s works is the best among the other two.",

It includes even more use cases, such as casual language analysis and computer vision tasks, as well as an introduction to OpenAI's Codex.Key FeaturesBuild and implement state-of-the-art language models, such as the original Transformer, BERT, T5, and GPT-2, using concepts that outperform classical deep learning modelsGo through hands-on applications in Python using Google Colaboratory Notebooks with nothing to install on a local machineTest transformer models on advanced use casesBook DescriptionThe transformer architecture has proved to be revolutionary in outperforming the classical RNN and CNN models in use today. With an apply-as-you-learn approach, Transformers for Natural Language Processing investigates in vast detail the deep learning for machine translations, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, language modeling, question answering, and many more NLP domains with transformers. The book takes you through NLP with Python and examines various eminent models and datasets within the transformer architecture created by pioneers such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Hugging Face. The book trains you in three stages. The first stage introduces you to transformer architectures, starting with the original transformer, before moving on to RoBERTa, BERT, and DistilBERT models. You will discover training methods for smaller transformers that can outperform GPT-3 in some cases. In the second stage, you will apply transformers for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). Finally, the third stage will help you grasp advanced language understanding techniques such as optimizing social network datasets and fake news identification. By the end of this NLP book, you will understand transformers from a cognitive science perspective and be proficient in applying pretrained transformer models by tech giants to various datasets.What you will learnUse the latest pretrained transformer modelsGrasp the workings of the original Transformer, GPT-2, BERT, T5, and other transformer modelsCreate language understanding Python programs using concepts that outperform classical deep learning modelsUse a variety of NLP platforms, including Hugging Face, Trax, and AllenNLPApply Python, TensorFlow, and Keras programs to sentiment analysis, text summarization, speech recognition, machine translations, and moreMeasure the productivity of key transformers to define their scope, potential, and limits in productionWho this book is forSince the book does not teach basic programming, you must be familiar with neural networks, Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow in order to learn their implementation with Transformers. Readers who can benefit the most from this book include experienced deep learning & NLP practitioners and data analysts & data scientists who want to process the increasing amounts of language-driven data.",

There are solutions in this area for special cases, but developing one general solution is impossible due to variety of grammatical, syntactic and semantic forms in different languages. The NLP algorithms and methods are used in speech recognition, text analyzing and understanding, speech generation. This paper is focused on application of NLP approaches to understand quasi-structured or unstructured data with subsequent inclusion in a knowledge base. The article covers the usage of a graph database as a knowledge base, that allows to show and visualize relationships between different pieces of text according to specified data patterns.",

From the 55 Scopus-indexed documents, 34 were manually identified and included in the study. The analyses reveal that 61.8 percent of these are journal articles and 38.2 percent are conference papers. Research productivity leaders in the ASEAN are Singapore for citation density; Indonesia for volume of work; and Malaysia for network strength. Thailand must fortify its link strength, but it poses as a research powerhouse with its robust number of citations. There is a trend in collaborative work with non-ASEAN countries, specifically with China, Saudi Arabia, Japan and the United States, and both local and international research funding sponsorships help increase research outputs. Prevailing themes are COVID-19 pandemic, social media, and sentiments on social media pertaining to the pandemic. More research funding sponsorships will close the research productivity gap among ASEAN countries. Tapping other sources of data, verifying social media perceptions using other sources of sentiments, and using Application Interface (API) will further enrich research on the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methodologies in the NLP research in the ASEAN during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The system enables us to immediately notify potential opportunities and threats that may arise for the relevant company portfolio and to take the necessary actions. The architecture can enrich portfolio management, increase a company's credit profitability, offer finance-specific functions and use time and resources effectively in collecting and evaluating information through various metrics. In this direction, we designated an infrastructure and addressed a wide variety of NLP issues to execute the system modules. Various NLP tasks such as text classification, text regression, impact measurement, and Named-Entity Recognition have been successfully solved with the latest techniques. Not only traditional machine learning techniques but also modern deep learning architectures such as RNN and Transformers have been utilized to solve financial tasks.",

      "abstract": "Computational natural language processing (NLP) is indispensable in a humanized ambience intelligence environment. NLP facilitates ambient intelligence by making machines understand, and be understood by, humans. This in turn makes machines behave more human-like than they typically are today. Technological advances in machine learning (ML), and especially deep learning (DL), have been a key enabler of NLP research. This paper begins with a survey of recent developments of ML/DL for NLP. It then identifies some of the most promising techniques reported in recent literature. These most promising techniques are then assembled into a reusable toolkit for computational NLP. The adaptable nature of the assembled toolkit allows it to be reused in a broad range of NLP applications. The paper then describes experimental evaluation of our implemented solutions for comparative analysis. Two specific NLP applications form the basis of comparative evaluation. The first involves identifying one of M English sentences that does not make sense. The second, which is harder than the first, involves choosing from among N sentences the one that best explains why a presented sentence is invalid. Human baseline accuracies for these applications are 99.1% and 97.8%, respectively. The observation that these results are somewhat less than perfect demonstrates that even humans can occasionally find these tasks difficult. It further underscores the difficulties involved in some of these computational NLP applications. Experiments conducted on benchmark data show that advanced ML/DL can achieve near-human performance in both computational NLP applications with accuracy scores of 96.1% and 93.7%, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Cybersecurity is the practice of preventing cyberattacks on vital infrastructure and private data. Government organisations, banks, hospitals, and every other industry sector are increasingly investing in cybersecurity infrastructure to safeguard their operations and the millions of consumers who entrust them with their personal information. Cyber threat activity is alarming in a world where businesses are more interconnected than ever before, raising concerns about how well organisations can protect themselves from widespread attacks. Threat intelligence solutions employ Natural Language Processing to read and interpret the meaning of words and technical data in various languages and find trends in them. It is becoming increasingly precise for machines to analyse various data sources in multiple languages using NLP. This paper aims to develop a system that targets software vulnerability detection as a Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem with source code treated as texts and addresses the automated software vulnerability detection with recent advanced deep learning NLP models. We have created and compared various deep learning models based on their accuracy and the best performer achieved 95% accurate results. Furthermore we have also made an effort to predict which vulnerability class a particular source code belongs to and also developed a robust dashboard using FastAPI and ReactJS.",

Because it can be easily collected, online reviews can be used as alternative data to understand customer satisfaction and many studies have attempted customer satisfaction modeling by converting online reviews, which are unstructured data, into structured data. Hence, this study presented an improved framework for conducting customer satisfaction modeling from online reviews and mixed unsupervised learning and supervised learning methods. Also, this study proposed a methodology using deep learning-based natural language processing techniques to supplement the methodological limitations of existing studies and to secure structured data for customer satisfaction modeling in the absence of labeled data. The study is expected to demonstrate the necessity of a detailed product improvement strategy through modeling according to the improvement of processing techniques for review text in customer satisfaction modeling research and to provide efficient product development/improvement guidelines to promote customer satisfaction.",

However, DNNs have proven to be vulnerable to attacks from adversarial examples. These samples are generated by adding some imperceptible disturbances, which are used to mislead the output decision of the deep learning model and bring significant security risks to the system. However, previous research mainly focused on computer vision, thus neglecting the security issues of natural language processing models. Since the text data is discrete, the existing methods in the image field cannot directly use the text. This article summarized the research on adversarial attacks and defenses in natural language processing and looked forward to future research directions.",

      "abstract": "Research and industry are becoming highly interested in automatically analyzing the opinion of general public from social networks with respect to a particular subject. Extracting the polarity from these data is always remaining as a significant bottleneck. Pre-trained models built on deep learning architecture can achieve this task in an effective manner by using transfer learning approach. Since it is difficult to develop a model from scratch, due to time constraints or computational limits, pre-trained models with vast potential and possibilities were introduced. They provide a benchmark to either improve the existing model or test the developed model against it. This paper discusses about various word embedding methods used for sentiment analysis followed by an overview on state-of-the-art pre-trained models used for natural language processing, which is commonly used in the process of sentiment analysis. Experimental results of two state-of-the-art pre-trained models are also analyzed.",

While these tests are conducted by psychologists, it is very easy to deceive them in order to get the personality type of our choice, as these questions are very straight forward. This paper focuses on automating this task with the help of Neural Networks by using images instead of questions. A labelled dataset with user responses on social media along with their personality type is used for analysis. After cleaning, relevant response features are extracted using NLP followed by applying suitable classification algorithms. A model is trained to accurately predict the personality type of users based on their responses, which is then deployed on an interactive website in the form of a personality test.",
