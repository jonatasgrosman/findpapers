      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDAnalysis of sequenced genomes from large three-generation families allows de novo mutations identified in Generation II individuals to be attributed to each of their parents germlines in Generation I. Because germline mutations increase with age, we hypothesized that they directly limit the duration of childbearing in women, and if correlated with mutation accumulation in somatic tissues, also reflect systemic aging in both sexes. Here we test whether the germline mutation rates of Generation I individuals when they were young adults predict their remaining survival, as well as the womens reproductive lifespans.\n\nMETHODSGermline autosomal mutation counts in 122 Generation I individuals (61 women, 61 men) from 41 three-generation Utah CEPH families were converted to germline mutation rates by normalizing each subjects number of mutations to the callable portion of their genome. Age at death, cause of death, all-site cancer incidence, and reproductive histories were provided by the Utah Population Database, Cancer Registry, and Utah Genetic Reference Project. Fertility analyses were restricted to the 53 women whose age at last birth (ALB) was at least 30 years, the approximate age when the decline in female fertility begins. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to test the association of age-adjusted mutation rates (AAMRs) with aging-related outcomes. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the age when adult germline mutation accumulation rates are established.\n\nFINDINGSQuartiles of increasing AAMRs were associated with increasing all-cause mortality rates in both sexes combined (test for trend, p=0.009); subjects in the top quartile of AAMRs experienced more than twice the mortality of bottom quartile subjects (hazard ratio [HR], 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-3.56; p=0.008; median survival difference = 4.7 years). Women with higher AAMRs had significantly fewer live births and a younger ALB. The analyses also indicate that adult germline mutation accumulation rates are established in adolescence, and that later menarche in women may delay mutation accumulation.\n\nINTERPRETATIONParental-age-adjusted germline mutation rates in healthy young adults may provide a measure of both reproductive and systemic aging. Puberty may induce the establishment of adult mutation accumulation rates, just when DNA repair genes expression levels are known to begin their lifelong decline.\n\nFUNDINGNIH R01AG038797 and R21AG054962 (to R.M.C.); University of Utah Program in Personalized Health (to H.D.M.); NIH T32GM007464 (to T.A.S.); NIH R01AG022095 (to K.R.S.); NIH R01HG006693, R01HG009141, and R01GM124355 (to A.R.Q.); NIH GM118335 and GM059290 (to L.B.J.); NIH P30CA2014 (to the Utah Population Database, a.k.a. the UPDB); National Center for Research Resources Public Health Services grant M01RR00064 (to the Huntsman General Clinical Research Center, University of Utah); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences NIH grant UL1TR002538 (to the University of Utahs Center for Clinical and Translational Science); Howard Hughes Medical Institute funding (to Ray White); gifts from the W.M.

Using 1,662 dried blood spot samples collected by 16 subjects over periods of weeks to years, we studied the behavior of 12 acute phase response (APR) and related proteins in inflammation events correlated with infection, vaccination, surgery, intense exercise and Crohns disease. Proteins were measured using SISCAPA mass spectrometry and normalized to constant plasma volume using low-variance proteins, generating high precision within-person biomarker trajectories with well-characterized personal baselines.

      "abstract": "BackgroundPediatric and adult high-grade glioma (HGG) frequently harbor PDGFRA alterations. We hypothesized that co-treatment with everolimus may improve the efficacy of dasatinib in PDGFR-driven glioma through combinatorial synergism and increased tumor accumulation of dasatinib.\n\nMethodsDose response, synergism studies, P-gp inhibition and pharmacokinetic studies were performed on in vitro and in vivo human and mouse models of HGG. Six patients with recurrent PDGFR-driven glioma were treated with dasatinib and everolimus.\n\nResultsDasatinib effectively inhibited the proliferation of mouse and human primary HGG cells with a variety of PDGFRA alterations. Dasatinib exhibited synergy with everolimus in the treatment of HGG cells at low nanomolar concentrations of both agents, with reduction in mTOR signaling that persists after dasatinib treatment alone. Prolonged exposure to everolimus significantly improved the CNS retention of dasatinib and extended survival of PPK tumor bearing mice. Pediatric patients (n=6) with glioma tolerated this combination without significant adverse events. Recurrent patients (n=4) demonstrated median overall survival of 8.5 months.\n\nConclusionEfficacy of dasatinib treatment of PDGFR-driven HGG is improved with everolimus and suggests a promising route for improving targeted therapy for this patient population.\n\nTrial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT03352427\n\nFundingThe authors thank the patients and their families for participation in this study.

      "abstract": "The electronic health record (EHR) holds the prospect of providing more complete and timely access to clinical information for studies, quality assessments, and quality improvement compared to other data sources, such as administrative claims. Our goal was to assess the completeness and timeliness of structured diagnoses in the EHR compared to computed diagnoses for hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). We determined the amount of time for a structured diagnosis to be recorded in the EHR from when an equivalent diagnosis could be computed from other structured data elements, such as vital signs and laboratory results. Using our local instance of EHR data in the PCORnet common data model (CDM) with encounters from January 1, 2012 through February 10, 2019, we identified patients with at least two observations above threshold separated by at least 30 days. The thresholds were outpatient blood pressure of [&ge;] 140/90 mmHg, any low-density lipoprotein [&ge;] 130 mg/dl, or any hemoglobin A1c [&ge;] 7%, respectively. The primary measure was the length of time between the computed diagnosis and the time at which a structured diagnosis could be identified within the EHR history or problem list. We found that 39.8% of those with HTN, 21.6% with HLD, and 1.0% with DM did not receive a corresponding structured diagnosis recorded in the EHR. For those who received a structured diagnosis, a mean of 389, 198, and 106 days elapsed before the patient had the corresponding diagnosis of HTN, HLD, or DM, respectively, recorded in the EHR. We identified a marked temporal delay between when a diagnosis can be computed or inferred and when an equivalent structured diagnosis is recorded within the EHR. These findings demonstrate the continued need for additional study of the EHR to avoid bias when using observational data and reinforce the need for computational approaches to identify clinical phenotypes.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundThe epidemiology and severity of non-falciparum malaria in endemic settings has garnered limited attention. We aimed to characterize the prevalence, interaction, clinical risk factors and temporal trends of non-falciparum malaria in endemic settings of Kenya.\n\nMethodsWe diagnosed and analyzed infecting malaria species via PCR in 2027 clinical samples collected between 2008 and 2016. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the prevalence and distribution of Plasmodium species. A statistical model was designed and used for estimating the frequency of Plasmodium species and assessing inter-species interactions. Mixed effect linear regression models with random intercepts for each location was used to test for change in prevalence over time.\n\nFindings72*5% of the samples were P. falciparum single species infections, 25{middle dot}8% were mixed infections and only 1*7% occurred as single non-falciparum species infections. 23*1% were mixed infections containing P. ovale. A likelihood-based model calculation of the population frequency of each species estimated a significant within-host interference between P. falciparum and P. ovale curtisi. Mixed-effect logistic regression models identified a significant increase of P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi species over time with reciprocal decrease in P. falciparum single species and P. malariae. The risk of P. falciparum infections presenting with fever was 0*43 times less likely if co-infected with P. malariae.\n\nInterpretationFindings show higher prevalence of non-falciparum malaria than expected. The proportion of infections that were positive for infection by P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi was observed to significantly increase over the period of study which could be due to attenuated responsiveness to malaria drug treatment on these species. The increase in frequency of P. ovale spp in Kenya could threaten malaria control effort in Kenya and pose increased risk of malaria to travelers.\n\nFundingAFHSB and its GEIS Section",

      "abstract": "ObjectiveEarly Fontan Failure (EFF) is a serious complication following total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC), characterised by high central venous pressure (CVP), low cardiac output and resistance to medical therapy. This study aimed to estimate post-operative CVP in TCPC patients (CVPTCPC) using data routinely collected during pre-operative assessment. We sought to determine if this metric correlated with measured post-operative CVP and if it was associated with EFF.\n\nMethodsIn this retrospective study, CVPTCPC was estimated in 131 patients undergoing pre-TCPC assessment by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and CVP measurement under general anaesthesia. Post-operative CVP during the first 24hours in ICU was collected from electronic patient records in a subset of patients. EFF was defined as death, transplantation, TCPC takedown or emergency fenestration within the first 30days.\n\nResultsEstimated CVPTCPC correlated significantly with CVPICU (r=0.26, p=0.03), particularly in patients without a fenestration (r=0.45, p=0.01). CVPTCPC was significantly associated with EFF (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.12 (1.02-1.24), p=0.02). A threshold of CVPTCPC [&ge;]33mmHg was found to have the highest specificity (90%) and sensitivity (67%) for identifying EFF (area under receiver operating curve, AUC = 0.79), OR 18.8 (3.1-114), p=0.001. This association was stronger in patients with single SVCs.\n\nConclusionsEstimated CVPTCPC is an easily calculated metric combining pre-operative pressure and flow data. Higher CVPTCPC is associated with an increased risk of EFF and is correlated with directly measured post-TCPC pressure. Identification of patients at risk of EFF has the potential to guide risk mitigation strategies.",

As a result, microbiome composition data from several large cohorts have been cross-sectionally linked to various lifestyle factors and diseases.1-5 In spite of these advances, prospective associations between microbiome composition and health have remained uncharacterized due to the lack of sufficiently large and representative population cohorts with comprehensive follow-up data.6-8 Here, we analyse the long-term association between gut microbiome variation and mortality in a large, well-phenotyped, and representative population cohort (n = 7211, FINRISK 2002; Finland).9 We report specific taxonomic and functional signatures related to the Enterobacteriaceae family in the human gut microbiome that predict mortality during a 15-year follow-up. These associations can be observed both in the Eastern and Western Finns who have differing genetic backgrounds, lifestyles, and mortality rates.10,11 Our results supplement previously reported cross-sectional associations,1-4,12 and help to establish a methodological and conceptual basis for examining long-term associations between human gut microbiome composition, incident outcomes, and general health status.

While previous studies have verified the artificial intelligence (AI) models for the classification of global sclerosis and glomerular cell proliferation, there are several other glomerular pathological findings required for diagnosis, and the comprehensive models for the classification of these major findings have not yet been reported. Whether the cooperation between these AI models and clinicians improves diagnostic performance also remains unknown. Here, we developed AI models to classify glomerular images for major findings required for pathological diagnosis and investigated whether those models could improve the diagnostic performance of nephrologists.\n\nMethodsWe used a dataset of 283 kidney biopsy cases comprising 15888 glomerular images that were annotated by a total of 25 nephrologists. AI models to classify seven pathological findings: global sclerosis, segmental sclerosis, endocapillary proliferation, mesangial matrix accumulation, mesangial cell proliferation, crescent, and basement membrane structural changes, were constructed using deep learning by fine-tuning of InceptionV3 convolutional neural network. Subsequently, we compared the agreement to truth labels between majority decision among nephrologists with or without the AI model as a voter.\n\nResultsOur model for global sclerosis showed high performance (area under the curve: periodic acid-Schiff, 0.986; periodic acid methenamine silver, 0.983); the models for the other findings also showed performance close to those of nephrologists. By adding the AI model output to majority decision among nephrologists, the sensitivity and specificity were significantly improved in 9 of 14 constructed models compared to those of nephrologists alone.\n\nConclusionOur study showed a proof-of-concept for the classification of multiple glomerular findings in a comprehensive method of deep learning and suggested its potential effectiveness in improving diagnostic accuracy of clinicians.",

      "abstract": "Due to the importance of automatic and early autism screening, in this paper, a cry-based screening approach for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is introduced. During the study, we realized that the ASD specific features are not necessarily observable among all children with ASD and among all instances of each child. Therefore, we proposed a new classification approach to be able to find such features and their corresponding instances. We tested the proposed approach and found two features that can be used to distinguish groups of children with ASD from Typically Developing (TD) children. In other words, these features are present in subsets of children with ASD not all of them. The approach has been tested on a dataset including 14 boys and 7 girls with ASD and 14 TD boys and 7 TD girls, between 18 to 53 months old. The sensitivity, specificity, and precision of the proposed approach for boys were 85.71%, 100%, and 92.85%, respectively. These measures were 71.42%, 100%, and 85.71% for girls, respectively.",

We used latent profile and latent transition analysis to study their emotional and behavioural profiles from early childhood to adolescence. We included sociodemographic, family and parenting variables to study the effect on latent profile membership and transitions.\n\nResultsThe number and specific profiles of emotional and behavioural symptoms changed with the developmental stage. We found a higher number of profiles for ages 3, 5, and 14, suggesting greater heterogeneity in the presentation of emotional and behavioural symptoms in early childhood and adolescence compared to late childhood. There was greater heterotypic continuity between ages 3 and 5, particularly in transitions from higher to lower severity profiles. Children exposed to socioeconomic disadvantages were more likely to belong or transition to any moderate or high emotional and behavioural symptoms profiles. Maternal psychological distress and harsh parenting were associated with internalizing and externalizing profiles, respectively. Higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms across development were associated with lower mental wellbeing and higher rates of self-harm and substance use in adolescence.\n\nConclusionEmotional and behavioural symptoms develop early in life, with levels of heterogeneity and heterotypic stability that change throughout development. These results call for interventions to prevent and treat paediatric mental illness that consider the heterogeneity and stability of symptoms across development.",

This study aimed to ascertain if interprofessional team training could improve a higher level of outcome such as behaviour and patient outcomes.\n\nMethodsA retrospective quantitative analysis of time critical points in a simulated cardiac arrest resuscitation, from a previous randomised study on the effects of Interprofessional Learning in ILS. The video recordings from the original study consisting of medical (n=48) and nursing (n=48) students were analysed to mark when either the IPL or UPL team performed a time critical intervention.\n\nResultsFive time-critical points for interventions were identified; confirmation of cardiac arrest, commencement of initial CPR, rhythm check, time to 1st shock and delay in restarting CPR. Parametric testing of each of these time-based criteria were subjected to an independent sample t-test with statistically significant findings in three of the five criteria in favour of those who had undertaken the interprofessional learning.\n\nConclusionOur results demonstrate that through an IPL approach in ILS there was a statistically different improvement in mean times to performing time-critical interventions, which if transferred to the clinical environment could improve and impact on both change of behaviour and patient outcomes in Kirkpatricks higher levels of evidence and effectiveness.\n\nThough this study shows that team behaviour and performing time-critical interventions can improve in the short-term, we acknowledge that further longitudinal studies are required to ascertain the effect of such improvement over time. So that both as researchers and educators we can make healthcare teams work safer and more efficiently to improve patient outcomes.\n\nO_TEXTBOXWhat this paper addsO_ST_ABSWhat is already knownC_ST_ABSLike simulation, intuitively we know that Interprofessional Learning and Team training should make a difference to clinical practice for those involved.

      "abstract": "ObjectiveMark-up of generalized interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) on EEG is an important step in the diagnosis and characterization of epilepsy. However, manual EEG mark-up is a time-consuming, subjective, and highly specialized task where the human reviewer needs to visually inspect a large amount of data to facilitate accurate clinical decisions. The objective of this study was to develop a framework for automated detection of generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA), which is a characteristic type of generalized IED seen in scalp EEG recordings of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a severe form of drug-resistant generalized epilepsy.\n\nMethodsWe studied 13 children with LGS who had GPFA events in their interictal EEG recordings. Time-frequency information derived from manually marked IEDs across multiple EEG channels was used to automatically detect similar events in each patients interictal EEG. We validated true positives and false positives of the proposed spike detection approach using both standalone scalp EEG and simultaneous EEG-functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) recordings.\n\nResultsGPFA events displayed a consistent low-high frequency arrangement in the time-frequency domain. This  bi-modal spectral feature was most prominent over frontal EEG channels. Our automatic detection approach using this feature identified likely epileptic events with similar time-frequency properties to the manually marked GPFAs. Brain maps of EEG-fMRI signal change during these automatically detected IEDs were comparable to the EEG-fMRI brain maps derived from manual IED mark-up.\n\nConclusionGPFA events have a characteristic bi-modal time-frequency feature that can be automatically detected from scalp EEG recordings in patients with LGS. Validity of this time-frequency feature is demonstrated by EEG-fMRI analysis of automatically detected events, which recapitulates the brain maps we have previously shown to underlie generalized IEDs in LGS.\n\nSignificanceThis study provides a novel methodology that paves the way for quick, automated, and objective inspection of generalized IEDs in LGS. The proposed framework may be extendable to a wider range of epilepsy syndromes in which monitoring the burden of epileptic activity can aid clinical decision-making. For example, automated quantification of generalized discharges may permit faster assessment of treatment response and estimation of future seizure risk.",

While some European countries found an association between the NT1 increase and H1N1 vaccination Pandemrix, reports from Asian countries suggested the H1N1 virus rather than Pandemrix to be linked with the increase of new NT1 cases. We analyzed the number of de-novo NT1 cases in the last two decades until 2016 using the European Narcolepsy Network (EU-NN) database. Using robust data-driven modelling approaches we confirmed the peak of NT1 incidence in 2009-2010 pH1N1 and identified a new peak in 2013 that is age-specific for children/adolescents. Most of these de-novo cases showed a subacute disease onset consistent with an immune-mediated type of narcolepsy, which is most likely not related to Pandemrix vaccination that was used in 2009-2010, but may have been triggered by some new epidemiological event in Europe. Our finding of an unexpected peak in de-novo children narcolepsy in 2013 provides a unique opportunity to develop new hypotheses, such as considering other (influenza) viruses to further investigate the pathophysiology of immune-mediated narcolepsy.",

MMFs were recorded to a repeating pseudoword /ta-ta/ with occasional changes in vowel identity, duration, or syllable frequency from 43 adults, 21 with confirmed dyslexia. Speech-sound changes elicited MMFs in bilateral auditory cortices, with no group differences in source strengths. MMFs to vowel identity and duration changes were left-lateralized. Better verbal working memory was associated with stronger left-hemispheric MMFs across groups, suggesting the relevance of verbal working memory for speech processing. Better technical reading was associated with stronger right-hemispheric MMFs in dyslexic readers, suggesting a right-hemispheric compensatory mechanism for language processing. In conclusion, contrary to prior work, our results did not support deficient speech discrimination in dyslexia.

      "abstract": "BackgroundThe metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an obesity-driven disorder with pandemic proportions and limited treatment options. Oxidative stress, low-grade inflammation and altered autonomic regulation, are important components of MetS pathophysiology. We recently reported that galantamine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and an FDA-approved drug (for Alzheimers disease) alleviates the inflammatory state in MetS subjects. Here we examined the effects of galantamine on oxidative stress in parallel with inflammatory and cardio-metabolic parameters in subjects with MetS.\n\nMethodsThe effects of galantamine treatment, 8 mg daily for 4 weeks, followed by 16 mg daily for 8 weeks or placebo were studied in randomly assigned subjects with MetS (n=22 per group) of both genders. Oxidative stress, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase activities, lipid and protein peroxidation, and nitrite levels were analyzed before and at the end of the treatment. In addition, plasma cytokine and adipokine levels, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and other relevant cardio-metabolic indices were analyzed. Autonomic regulation was also examined by heart rate variability (HRV) before treatment, and at every 4 weeks of treatment.\n\nResultsGalantamine treatment significantly increased antioxidant enzyme activities, including SOD (+1.65 USOD/mg protein, [95% CI 0.39 to 2.92], P=0.004) and CAT (+0.93 nmol/mg, [95% CI 0.34 to 1.51], P=0.011), decreased lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, -5.45 pmol/mg, [95% CI -10.97 to 0.067], P=0.053) and systemic nitrite levels (-0.05 nit/mg protein, [95% CI -0.21 to 0.10], P=0.038) compared with placebo. In addition, galantamine significantly alleviated the inflammatory state and insulin resistance, and decreased the low frequency/high frequency ratio of HRV, following 8 and 12 weeks of drug treatment.\n\nConclusionLow-dose galantamine alleviates oxidative stress, alongside beneficial anti-inflammatory, and metabolic effects, and modulates autonomic regulation in subjects with MetS. These findings are of considerable interest for further studies with galantamine to ameliorate MetS pathophysiology.",

There was strong evidence for an association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and later smoking (OR 4.59, 95% CI 3.60 to 5.85) when the results were meta-analysed in a random effects model. However, there was high heterogeneity (I2 = 88%).\n\nConclusionsWhilst the association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and subsequent smoking appears strong, the available evidence is limited by the reliance on self-report measures of smoking history without biochemical verification. None of the studies included negative controls which would provide stronger evidence for whether the association may be causal. Much of the evidence also failed to consider the nicotine content of e-liquids used by non-smokers meaning it is difficult to make conclusions about whether nicotine is the mechanism driving this association.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundIn a longitudinal study assessing the WHO strategy for yaws eradication using mass azithromycin treatment, we observed resurgence of yaws cases with dominance of a single JG8 sequence type and emergence of azithromycin-resistant Treponema pallidum. Here, we analyse genomic changes in the bacterial population using samples collected during the study.\n\nMethodsWe performed whole bacterial genome sequencing directly on DNA extracted from 37 lesion swabs collected from patients on Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, between 2013 and 2016. We produced phylogenies and correlated these with temporo-spatial information to investigate the source of new cases and the emergence of five macrolide-resistant cases. We used deep amplicon sequencing of surveillance samples to assess the presence of minority macrolide resistance populations.\n\nFindingsWe recovered 20 whole Treponema genomes, and phylogenetic analysis showed that the re-emerging JG8 sequence type was composed of three bacterial sub-lineages characterised by distinct temporo-spatial patterns. Of five patients with resistant Treponema, all epidemiologically linked, we recovered genomes from three and found no variants. Deep sequencing showed that pre-treatment, the index patient harboured fixed macrolide-sensitive Treponema, while the post-treatment sample harboured a fixed resistant genotype, as did three of four contact cases. We also found no evidence of pre-existing minority Treponema drug-resistance variants in the general population.\n\nInterpretationIn this study, re-emergence of yaws cases was polyphyletic, indicating multiple epidemiological sources. However, given the genomic and epidemiological linkage of resistant cases and the rarity of resistance alleles in the general population, it is likely that azithromycin resistance evolved only once in this study, followed by onward dissemination.\n\nFundingWellcome (Grant #206194), Provintial Deputation of Barcelona (Grant #1940000465).\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed using the terms \"yaws\", \"Treponema pallidum\", \"mass treatment\", and \"azithromycin\", without date or language restrictions. Mass drug administration (MDA) using azithromycin (single-dose 30 mg/kg, maximum 2 g) has been a successful strategy to reduce yaws prevalence in endemic communities, with trials conducted in both Papua New Guinea and Ghana. However, there are no long-term follow-up studies other than in Papua New Guinea, where a resurgence of yaws cases was observed 24-months after MDA. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) showed a change in Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue (TPE) to a single dominant JG8 type, and identified resistant strains with the same MLST type, but this method lacked the resolution to determine the epidemiological mechanism leading to yaws re-emergence and how macrolide resistance manifested.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis study is the first to use whole genome sequencing (WGS) for a detailed investigation of TPE transmission and to apply deep amplicon sequencing to TPE macrolide resistance mutations. Leveraging the increased resolution of WGS over other techniques, we show that re-emergence of yaws after MDA was the result of at least three distinct bacterial sub-lineages with different temporo-spatial properties (likely due to several infected people missing treatment) rather than a single point-source. WGS also shows that patients with macrolide-resistant yaws had genomically indistinguishable TPE, indicating a recent common ancestor, and possibly a recent chain of transmission originating from the index case. Deep amplicon sequencing corroborates that PCR-tested macrolide sensitive samples do not harbour resistant minority populations at detectable levels.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceOur data suggest yaws re-emergence after MDA was driven by multiple sources, and therefore we recommend higher population coverage and intensive post-MDA surveillance. These data show resistance likely evolved once during the trial, rather than being widespread. We recommend careful monitoring of affected communities during post-MDA follow-up in order to rapidly detect new emergence of azithromycin resistance, and consideration for using alternative treatments for cases detected post-MDA.",

This study reports the proportion recommended for hysterectomy and associated factors, recommended treatments by stage, and treatment uptake.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a prospective study among patients seeking care for cervical cancer at public referral hospitals in Uganda. In-person surveys were followed by a phone call. Descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses examined associations between predictors and outcomes.\n\nResultsAmong 268 participants, 76% were diagnosed at an advanced stage (IIB-IVB). In total, 12% were recommended for hysterectomy. In adjusted analysis, living within 15 kilometers of Kampala (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.20-8.03) and prior screening (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.22-6.83) were significantly associated with surgical candidacy. Radiotherapy availability was not significantly associated with treatment recommendations for early-stage (IA-IIA) disease, but was associated with recommended treatment modality (chemo-radiation versus primary chemotherapy) for locally advanced stage (IIB-IIIB). Most (67%) had started treatment. No demographic or health factor, treatment recommendation, or radiation availability was associated with treatment initiation. Among those recommended for hysterectomy, 55% underwent surgery. Among those who had initiated treatment, 82% started the modality that was actually recommended.\n\nConclusionWomen presented to public referral centers in Kampala with mostly advanced-stage cervical cancer and few were recommended for surgery. Lack of access to radiation did not significantly increase the proportion of early-stage cancers recommended for hysterectomy.",

However, developing these applications requires precise and sensitive calling of somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) from cfDNA sequencing data. To date, no SNV caller addresses all the special challenges of cfDNA to provide reliable results. Here we present cfSNV, a revolutionary somatic SNV caller with five innovative techniques to overcome and exploit the unique properties of cfDNA. cfSNV provides hierarchical mutation profiling, thanks to cfDNAs complete coverage of the clonal landscape, and multi-layer error suppression. In both simulated datasets and real patient data, we demonstrate that cfSNV is superior to existing tools, especially for low-frequency somatic SNVs. We also show how the five novel techniques contribute to its performance. Further, we demonstrate a clinical application using cfSNV to select non-small-cell lung cancer patients for immunotherapy treatment.",

      "abstract": "Ebola virus is a highly pathogenic RNA virus that causes haemorrhagic fever in human. With very high mortality rate, Ebola virus is considered as one of the dangerous viruses in the world. Although, the Ebola outbreaks claimed many lives in the past, no satisfactory treatment or vaccine have been discovered yet to fight against Ebola. For this reason, in this study, various tools of bioinformatics and immunoinformatics were used to design possible vaccines against Zaire Ebola virus strain Mayinga-76. To construct the vaccine, three potential antigenic proteins of the virus, matrix protein VP40, envelope glycoprotein and nucleoprotein were selected against which the vaccines would be designed. The MHC class-I, MHC class-II and B-cell epitopes were determined and after robust analysis through various tools and molecular docking analysis, three vaccine candidates, designated as EV-1, EV-2 and EV-3, were constructed. Since the highly conserved epitopes were used for vaccine construction, these vaccine constructs are also expected to be effective on other strains of Ebola virus like strain Gabon-94 and Kikwit-95. Next, the molecular docking study on these vaccine constructs were analyzed by molecular docking study and EV-1 emerged as the best vaccine construct. Later, molecular dynamics simulation study revealed the good performances as well as good stability of the vaccine protein. Finally, codon adaptation and in silico cloning were conducted to design a possible plasmid (pET-19b plasmid vector was used) for large scale, industrial production of the EV-1 vaccine.",

Trends were compared to those in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS).\n\nSettingOutpatient visits in Massachusetts between January 2011 and September 2015.\n\nParticipants5,075,908 individuals with commercial health insurance or Medicaid in Massachusetts under the age of 65 and 495,515 patients included in NAMCS.\n\nMain outcomes and measuresThe number of antibiotic prescriptions avoided through reductions in observed disease and reductions in per-visit prescribing rate per medical condition.\n\nResultsBetween 2011 and 2015, the January antibiotic prescribing rate per 1,000 individuals in Massachusetts declined by 18.9% and the July antibiotic prescribing rate declined by 13.6%. The mean prescribing rate for children under 5 declined by 42.8% (95% CI 21.7%, 59.4%), principally reflecting reduced wintertime prescribing. The monthly rate of outpatient visits per 1,000 individuals in Massachusetts declined (p < 0.05) for respiratory infections and urinary tract infections. Nationally, visits for medical conditions that merit an antibiotic prescription also declined between 2010 and 2015. Of the estimated 358 antibiotic prescriptions per 1,000 individuals avoided over the study period in Massachusetts, 59% (95% CI 54%, 63%) were attributable to reductions in observed disease and 41% (95% CI 37%, 46%) to reductions in prescribing per outpatient visit.\n\nConclusions and relevanceThe decline in antibiotic prescribing in Massachusetts was driven by a decline in observed disease and improved antibiotic stewardship, with a contemporaneous reduction in visits for conditions prompting antibiotics observed nationally. A focus on infectious disease prevention should be considered alongside antibiotic stewardship as a means to reduce antibiotic prescribing.\n\nKey pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow did the separate mechanisms of improved stewardship and reductions in observed disease contribute to a 5-year decline in outpatient antibiotic prescribing in Massachusetts from 2011-2015?\n\nFindingsIn an observational analysis of insurance claims, reduced monthly rates of outpatient visits for infectious conditions and reduced probability of prescribing an antibiotic per outpatient visit both contributed to the decline in antibiotic prescribing. An estimated 358 antibiotic prescriptions per 1,000 individuals were avoided over the study period through the two mechanisms, 211 of which were attributable to reductions in outpatient visits and 147 to reduced antibiotic prescribing per visit.\n\nMeaningPreventing the need for outpatient visits should be considered alongside antibiotic stewardship as a means of reducing antibiotic prescribing.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence marks a period where depression will commonly onset and previous research using twin studies has suggested that genetic influences play a role in how depression develops and changes across adolescence. Recent genome-wide association studies have also shown that common genetic variants - which can be combined into a polygenic risk score (PRS) - are also implicated in depression. However, the role of PRS in adolescent depression and changes in adolescent depression is not yet understood. We aimed to examine the association between a PRS for depressive symptoms and depressive symptoms across adolescence and young adulthood, and how polygenic risk is associated with changes in depressive symptoms using two methods: cross-sectional analysis and multilevel growth curve modelling to examine the rate of change over time. Using data from over 6000 participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) we examined associations between genetic liability to depressive symptoms (PRS for depressive symptoms) and self-reported depressive symptoms (short mood and feelings questionnaire over 9 occasions from 10-24 years). We examined cross-sectional associations at each age and longitudinal trajectories of depressive symptoms in a repeated measures framework using growth curve analysis. The PRS was associated with depressive symptoms throughout adolescence and young adulthood in cross-sectional and growth curve analyses, though associations were stronger in the latter analyses. Growth curve analyses also provided additional insights, demonstrating that individuals with a higher PRS had steeper trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence with a greater increasing rate of change. These results show that common genetics variants as indexed by a PRS for depressive symptoms influence both the severity and rate of change in adolescent depressive symptoms. Longitudinal data that make use of repeated measures designs have the potential to provide greater insights into the factors that influence the onset and persistence of adolescent depression.",

In India, incidents of WPV against health workforce have become common in recent years. However, there is no synthesized evidence on the nationwide burden of WPV in healthcare. This study aims to systematically evaluate the current evidence on the prevalence, characteristics, and associated factors of WPV against healthcare professionals in India.\n\nMethodsWe systematically searched seven major databases and additional sources to retrieved published literature on WPV in India. We included empirical studies without any time restriction, which reported the prevalence of WPV against healthcare professionals in India. Following data extraction, we estimated the pooled prevalence of WPV using random-effects model in meta-analysis. The characteristics and associated factors of WPV were narratively synthesized from these empirical studies.\n\nResultsAmong 1065 articles retrieved from multiple sources, 15 studies met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of WPV among 2849 participants in those 15 studies was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54%-72%). In the subgroup analyses, the pooled prevalence for male and female was 64% (95% CI, 51%-78%) and 54% (95% CI, 47%-62%) respectively. Moreover, pooled prevalence in 12-months and lifetime was 55% (95% CI, 43%-67%) and 69% (95% CI, 61%-78%) respectively. Among the participants, the prevalence of verbal violence (52%; 95% CI, 45%-60%) was higher than physical violence (8%; 95% CI, 5%-11%). The emergency department was a common location of WPV, whereas the patients attendants were perpetrators in most studies. Major factors associated with WPV included ineffective patient-provider communication, less experience of the healthcare professionals, overcrowding, shortage of resources, long waiting hours, lack of security measures, dissatisfaction about health services, high cost of care, the negative role of media, and other socio-behavioral problems among the patients and healthcare professionals.\n\nConclusionWPV is highly prevalent among healthcare professionals in India. Critical challenges within the healthcare and social context necessitate further research, better policymaking, and multipronged interventions to address the same and prevent WPV against healthcare professionals in India.",

In addition, the lesion mechanism was dislocation by high-velocity trauma in 9 cases and by low-velocity trauma in 3. All 7 males (63.6%) were affected by high-velocity trauma, and 2 of the 3 females by low-velocity trauma. Only one patient had an isolated popliteal artery lesion associated with fractures in the leg or in contralateral limb. Patients with low-velocity traumas were older than 54 years while those with high-velocity were aged from 22 to 71 years.\n\nResultsThe lesion mechanism was dislocation due to high-velocity trauma in eight patients and due to low-velocity trauma in three. In 10/11 patients (90.9%) revascularization was performed after osteoarticular stabilization. after reduction of the dislocation or fracture. Intraoperative angiography was selectively used. Two patients required above-knee amputation after the procedure: one due to infection of the surgical access and the other due to severe soft tissue injury. One patient died during hospitalization due to trauma-related complications and comorbidities.\n\nConclusionsRevascularization success is not associated with high- or low-velocity traumas.

The method terminates level averaging of ABR recordings upon detection of time-locked waveform through cross-correlation analysis. The threshold level was then indicated by a dramatic increase in the sweep numbers required to produce \"qualified\" level averaging.

      "abstract": "BackgroundComplex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) presents as chronic, continuous pain and sensory, autonomic, and motor abnormalities affecting one or more extremities. People with CRPS can also show changes in their perception of and attention to the affected body part and sensory information in the affected side of space. Prism Adaptation (PA) is a behavioural intervention targeted at reducing attention deficits in post-stroke hemispatial neglect. PA also appears to reduce pain and other CRPS symptoms; however, these therapeutic effects have been demonstrated only in small unblinded studies. This paper describes the protocol for an ongoing double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of PA treatment for CRPS. The secondary aims of the study are to examine the relationships between neuropsychological changes (such as spatial attention, space and body representation, and motor spatial performance) and clinical manifestations of CRPS, as well as symptom improvement.\n\nMethodsForty-two participants with upper-limb CRPS type I will undergo two weeks of twice-daily PA treatment or sham treatment. The primary outcome measures are current pain intensity and CRPS severity score, measured immediately before and after the treatment period. Secondary outcome measures include the results of self-report questionnaires about pain, movement, symptoms interference, and body representation; clinical assessments of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions; and computer-based psychophysical tests of neuropsychological functions. Data are collected in four research visits: four weeks and one day before treatment, and one day and four weeks after the end of treatment. Additional follow-up through postal questionnaires is conducted three and six months post-treatment.\n\nDiscussionIt is hypothesised that participants undergoing PA treatment, compared to those receiving sham treatment, will show greater reduction in pain and CRPS severity score, and improvements on other clinical and neuropsychological measures. Also, more pronounced neuropsychological symptoms are predicted to correlate with more severe clinical CRPS symptoms. This study will provide the first randomized double-blind evaluation of the therapeutic effects of PA that could be implemented as a rehabilitation method for CRPS, and will contribute to the understanding of how neuropsychological changes in body representation and attention pertain to the manifestation and treatment of CRPS.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundRecent studies demonstrated that Aquamin(R), a calcium-, magnesium-, and multiple trace element-rich natural product, improves barrier structure and function in colonoids obtained from tissue of healthy subjects. The goal of the present study was to determine if the colonic barrier could be improved in tissue from subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC).\n\nMethodsColonoid cultures were established with tissue from 9 individuals with UC. The colonoids were then incubated for a 2-week period under control conditions (i.e., in culture medium with a final calcium concentration of 0.25 mM) or in the same medium supplemented with Aquamin(R) to provide 1.5 - 4.5 mM calcium. Effects on differentiation and barrier protein expression were determined using several approaches: phase-contrast & scanning electron microscopy, quantitative histology & immunohistology, mass spectrometry-based proteome assessment and transmission electron microscopy.\n\nResultsAquamin(R)-treated colonoids demonstrated a modest up-regulation of tight junctional proteins but stronger induction of adherens junction proteins and desmosomal proteins. Increased desmosomes were seen at the ultrastructural level. Proteomic analysis also demonstrated increased expression of basement membrane proteins and hemidesmosomal components. Proteins expressed at the apical surface (mucins and trefoils) were also increased as were several additional proteins with anti-microbial activity or that modulate inflammation.\n\nConclusionA majority of individuals including patients with UC do not reach the recommended daily intake for calcium and other minerals. The findings presented here suggest that adequate mineral intake might improve the colonic barrier.",

      "abstract": "PurposeTo identify emotional and behavioural symptoms profiles from early childhood to adolescence, their stability across development and associated factors.\n\nMethodsOur sample included 17,216 children assessed at ages 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14 years from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. We used latent profile and latent transition analysis to study their emotional and behavioural profiles from early childhood to adolescence. We included sociodemographic, family and parenting variables to study the effect on latent profile membership and transitions.\n\nResultsThe number and specific profiles of emotional and behavioural symptoms changed with the developmental stage. We found a higher number of profiles for ages 3, 5, and 14, suggesting greater heterogeneity in the presentation of emotional and behavioural symptoms in early childhood and adolescence compared to late childhood. There was greater heterotypic continuity between ages 3 and 5, particularly in transitions from higher to lower severity profiles. Children exposed to socioeconomic disadvantages were more likely to belong or transition to any moderate or high emotional and behavioural symptoms profiles. Maternal psychological distress and harsh parenting were associated with internalizing and externalizing profiles, respectively. Higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms across development were associated with lower mental wellbeing and higher rates of self-harm and substance use in adolescence.\n\nConclusionEmotional and behavioural symptoms develop early in life, with levels of heterogeneity and heterotypic stability that change throughout development. These results call for interventions to prevent and treat paediatric mental illness that consider the heterogeneity and stability of symptoms across development.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundLeft ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a condition characterised by trabeculations in the myocardial wall and is the subject of considerable conjecture as to whether it represents a distinct pathology or a secondary phenotype associated with other cardiac diseases, particularly cardiomyopathies. We sought to investigate the genetic architecture of LVNC by identifying genes and variant classes robustly associated with disease and comparing these to other genetically characterised cardiomyopathies.\n\nMethodsWe performed rare variant association analysis using six different LVNC cohorts comprising 840 cases together with 125,748 gnomAD population controls and compared results to similar analyses with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cases.\n\nResultsWe observed substantial overlap in genes and variant classes enriched in LVNC and DCM/HCM, indicating that in many cases LVNC belongs to a spectrum of more established cardiomyopathies, with non-compaction representing a phenotypic variation in patients with DCM- or HCM-causing variants. In contrast, five variant classes were uniquely enriched in LVNC cases, of which truncating variants in MYH7, ACTN2 and PRDM16 may represent a distinct LVNC aetiology. MYH7 truncating variants are generally considered as non-pathogenic but were detected in 2% of LVNC cases compared to 0.1% of controls, including a cluster of variants around a single splice region. Individuals with MYH7 truncating variants identified in the UK Biobank and cohorts of healthy volunteers also displayed significantly greater non-compaction compared to matched controls, with 50% meeting the diagnostic criteria for LVNC. Additionally, structural variants (exon deletions) in RYR2 and missense variants in the transmembrane region of HCN4 were enriched in LVNC cases, confirming prior reports regarding the association of these variant classes with combined LVNC and arrhythmia phenotypes.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrated that genetic association analysis can clarify the relationship between LVNC and established cardiomyopathies, highlighted substantial overlap with DCM/HCM but also identified variant classes associated with distinct LVNC and with joint LVNC/arrhythmia phenotypes. These results underline the complex genetic landscape of LVNC and inform how genetic testing in LVNC cases should be pursued and interpreted.",

FRAX without bone mineral density (BMD) was used to estimate fracture probability.\n\nResultsFRAX significantly overestimated the risk of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) in the WHI study. The most enormous overestimation was observed in women with low GRS (predicted/observed ratio [POR]: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.45-1.79), in Asian women (POR: 3.5, 95% CI 2.48-4.81), and in African American women (POR: 2.59, 95% CI: 2.33-2.87).

      "abstract": "Background & AimsAccurate and noninvasive diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis is essential for effective clinical management of chronic liver disease (CLD). We aimed to identify serum metabolite markers that reliably predict the stage of fibrosis in CLD patients.\n\nMethodsWe quantitatively profiled serum metabolites of participants in 2 independent cohorts. Based on the metabolomics data from Cohort 1 (504 HBV associated liver fibrosis patients and 502 normal controls, NC), we selected a panel of 4 predictive metabolite markers. Consequently, we constructed 3 machine learning models with the 4 metabolite markers using random forest (RF), to differentiate CLD patients from normal controls (NC), to differentiate cirrhosis patients from fibrosis patients, and to differentiate advanced fibrosis from early fibrosis, respectively.\n\nResultsThe panel of 4 metabolite markers consisted of taurocholate, tyrosine, valine, and linoelaidic acid. The RF models of the metabolite panel demonstrated the strongest stratification ability in Cohort 1 to diagnose CLD patients from NC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.997 and the precision-recall curve (AUPR) = 0.994), to differentiate fibrosis from cirrhosis (0.941, 0.870), and to stage liver fibrosis (0.918, 0.892). The diagnostic accuracy of the models was further validated in an independent Cohort 2 consisting of 300 CLD patients with chronic HBV infection and 90 NC. The AUCs of the models were consistently higher than APRI, FIB-4 and AST/ALT ratio, with both greater sensitivity and specificity.\n\nConclusionOur study showed that this 4-metabolite panel has potential usefulness in clinical assessments of CLD progression.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundEthiopia is a priority country of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to improve vaccination coverage and equitable uptake. The Ethiopian National Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) and the Global Vaccine Action Plan set coverage goals of 90% at national level and 80% at district level by 2020. This study aims to analyse basic vaccination coverage among children in Ethiopia and to estimate the equity impact by socioeconomic, geographic, maternal and child characteristics based on data from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2016.\n\nMethodsBasic vaccination coverage (1-dose BCG, 3-doses DPT-HepB-Hib, 3-doses polio, 1-dose measles vaccine) of 2,004 children aged 12-23 months was analysed. Mean coverage was disaggregated by socioeconomic (household wealth, religion, ethnicity), geographic (area of residence, region), maternal (maternal age at birth, maternal education, maternal marital status, sex of household head) and child (sex of child, birth order) characteristics. Concentration indices assessed wealth and education-related inequalities. Multiple logistic regression estimated associations between basic vaccination coverage and socioeconomic, maternal and child characteristics.\n\nResultsNational coverage for basic vaccinations was 39.7% in 2016. Single vaccination coverage ranged between between 53.2% (DTP3) and 69.2% (BCG). Wealth and maternal education related inequities were present for all vaccines. Children from richer households, urban regions, primary maternal education and male headed households were associated with higher vaccination coverage. The Ethiopia Mini Demographic and Health Survey 2019 reports national coverage for basic vaccinations at 43.3% with single vaccination coverage ranging between 57.8% (measles) and 74.2% (BCG).\n\nConclusionsVaccination coverage has improved from 2016 to 2019, but remains below the coverage goals of the EPI. Low vaccination coverage is associated with poorer households, rural regions of Afar and Somali, no maternal education and female headed households. Targeted approaches are necessary to improve vaccination coverage among these population subgroups and equitable uptake of vaccines in Ethiopia.",

Additionally, we determined prevalence rates using traditional criteria.\n\nRESULTSPrevalence of amnestic MCI was 5.9%. Other MCI subtypes ranged 4.3% to 7.7%. MCI with and without memory impairment was associated with older age and rurality. Depression, diabetes and low educational attainment were associated with MCI without memory impairment. Using traditional criteria, prevalence of MCI was lower (2.2% amnestic MCI, other subtypes ranged 1.3%-2.4%).\n\nDISCUSSIONOlder age, depression, low education, diabetes, and rurality were associated with increased risk of MCI among older adults in Mexico. Our findings suggest that the causes of cognitive impairment are likely multifactorial and may vary by MCI subtype.\n\nResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSSystematic reviewC_ST_ABSWe reviewed the literature using Google Scholar and PubMed. Few studies have reported prevalence rates for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Mexican population. These studies have primarily relied on limited cognitive assessments, and diverse MCI criteria.

      "abstract": "BackgroundDifferent formulae have been developed globally to estimate gestational age (GA) by ultrasonography in the first trimester of pregnancy. In this study, we develop an Indian population-specific dating formula and compare its performance with published formulae. Finally, we evaluate the implications of the choice of dating method on preterm birth (PTB) rate. This studys data was from GARBH-Ini, an ongoing pregnancy cohort of North Indian women to study PTB.\n\nMethodsComparisons between ultrasonography-Hadlock and last menstrual period (LMP) based dating methods were made by studying the distribution of their differences by Bland-Altman analysis. Using data-driven approaches, we removed data outliers more efficiently than by applying clinical parameters. We applied advanced machine learning algorithms to identify relevant features for GA estimation and developed an Indian population-specific formula (Garbhini-GA1) for the first trimester. PTB rates of Garbhini-GA1 and other formulae were compared by estimating sensitivity and accuracy.\n\nResultsPerformance of Garbhini-GA1 formula, a non-linear function of crown-rump length (CRL), was equivalent to published formulae for estimation of first trimester GA (LoA, - 0.46,0.96 weeks). We found that CRL was the most crucial parameter in estimating GA and no other clinical or socioeconomic covariates contributed to GA estimation. The estimated PTB rate across all the formulae including LMP ranged 11.27 - 16.50% with Garbhini-GA1 estimating the least rate with highest sensitivity and accuracy. While the LMP-based method overestimated GA by three days compared to USG-Hadlock formula; at an individual level, these methods had less than 50% agreement in the classification of PTB.\n\nConclusionsAn accurate estimation of GA is crucial for the management of PTB. Garbhini-GA1, the first such formula developed in an Indian setting, estimates PTB rates with higher accuracy, especially when compared to commonly used Hadlock formula. Our results reinforce the need to develop population-specific gestational age formulae.",

      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the cause of a fourth of all cancer-related deaths. About a third of all lung adenocarcinoma tumours harbour mutations on exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Detection of these mutations allows for targeted therapies in the form of EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In our study, we utilized malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) as \"liquid biopsies\" to detect EGFR mutations when tissue biopsies were unavailable. We showed that a direct sequencing approach was likely to miss SNVs in MPEs. We then optimized an EGFR mutant-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based assay and piloted it on n=10 pleural effusion samples (1 non-malignant pleural effusion as a negative control). 5/9 (55.55%) samples harboured EGFR mutations with 2/9 (22.22%) being exon 19 deletions and 3/9 (33.33%) had the S768I exon 20 mutation. The frequency of the S768I SNV in our study was significantly higher than that observed in other studies ([~]0.3%). Utilizing publicly available cBioPortal data, we report that patients with the S768I SNV had a shorter median survival time, progression-free survival time and lower tumor mutation count compared to patients with other EGFR mutations. These data suggest that this point mutation predicts poor prognosis as a result of aggressive disease, though studies in larger cohorts are necessary to confirm these findings. The high frequency of S768I mutations seen in our study also suggests that cancer cells harbouring these mutations may be superior in their ability to migrate, home or reside in pleural fluid.",

      "abstract": "Various psychological and biological pathways have been proposed as mediators between childhood adverse events (CA) and psychosis. A systematic review of the evidence in this domain is needed. The aim of this work is to systematically review the evidence on psychological and biological mediators between CA and psychosis across the psychosis spectrum. This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (registration number: CRD42018100846). Articles published between 1979 and July 2019 were identified through a literature search in OVID (PsychINFO; Medline and Embase). The evidence by each analysis and each study results are presented by group of mediator categories found in the review. The percentage of total effect mediated was calculated. 47 studies were included, with a total of 79,668 from general population (GP) and 3,189 from clinical samples. The quality of studies was judged as \"fair\". Our results showed (i) solid evidence of mediation between CA and psychosis by negative cognitive schemas about the self, the world, and others (NS); by dissociation and other PTSD symptoms; (ii) evidence of al mediation through an affective pathway (affective dysregulation, anxiety, and depression) in GP; (iii) lack of studies exploring biological mediators. To conclude, we found evidence suggesting that various overlapping and not competing pathways contribute partially to the link between adversity and psychosis. Experiences of adversity, along with relevant mediators such as PTSD and mood related symptoms and NS, should be routinely assessed in patients with psychosis. Targeting such mediators through cognitive behavioural aproaches using trauma-focused therapy and/or pharmacological means could be a useful addition to the traditional treatment of positive symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. High heritability of SCZ suggests a major role for transmitted genetic variants. Furthermore, SCZ is also associated with a marked reduction in fecundity, leading to the hypothesis that alleles with large effects on risk might often occur de novo. In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing for 23 families from two cohorts with matched unaffected siblings and parents. Two nonsense de novo mutations (DNMs) in GJC1 and HIST1H2AD were identified in SCZ patients. Ten genes (DPYSL2, NBPF1, SDK1, ZNF595, ZNF718, GCNT2, SNX9, AACS, KCNQ1 and MSI2) were found to carry more DNMs in SCZ patients than their unaffected siblings by burden test. Expression analyses indicated that these DNM implicated genes showed significantly higher expression in prefrontal cortex in prenatal stage. The DNM in the GJC1 gene is highly likely a loss function mutation (pLI = 0.94), leading to the dysregulation of ion channel in the glutamatergic excitatory neurons. Analysis of rare variants in independent exome sequencing dataset indicates that GJC1 has significantly more rare variants in SCZ patients than in unaffected controls. Data from genome-wide association studies suggested that common variants in the GJC1 gene may be associated with SCZ and SCZ-related traits. Genes co-expressed with GJC1 are involved in SCZ, SCZ-associated pathways and drug targets. These evidence suggest that GJC1 may be a risk gene for SCZ and its function may be involved in prenatal and early neurodevelopment, a vulnerable period for developmental disorders such as SCZ.",

Current wearable methods analyzing time components (e.g., pulse transit time) still lack clinical accuracy, whereas existing technologies for direct BP measurement are too bulky. Here we present a new art of continuous non-invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring (CNAP2GO). It directly measures BP by using a new \"volume control technique\" and could be used for small wearable sensors integrated in a finger ring. As a software prototype, CNAP2GO showed excellent BP measurement performance in comparison with invasive BP in 46 patients having surgery. The resulting pulsatile BP signal carries information to derive cardiac output and other hemodynamic variables. We show that CNAP2GO can be miniaturized for wearable approaches. CNAP2GO potentially constitutes the breakthrough for wearable sensors for blood pressure and flow monitoring in both ambulatory and in-hospital clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundGrowing evidence suggests a role of occupation in the emergence and manifestation of dementia. Occupations are often defined by complexity level, although working environments and activities differ in several other important ways. We aimed to capture the multi-faceted nature of occupation through its measurement as a qualitative (instead of a quantitative) variable and explored its relationship with different types of dementia.\n\nMethodsWe collected occupational information of 2,121 dementia patients with various suspected etiologies from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (age: 67{+/-}8, 57% male, MMSE: 21{+/-}5). Our final sample included individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD) dementia (n=1,467), frontotemporal dementia (n=281), vascular dementia (n=98), Lewy Body disease (n=174) and progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration (n=101). Within the AD group, we used neuropsychological data to further characterize patients by clinical phenotypes. All participants were categorized into one of 11 occupational classes, across which we evaluated the distribution of dementia (sub)types with Chi2 analyses. We gained further insight into occupation-dementia relationships through post-hoc logistic regressions that included various demographic and health characteristics as explanatory variables.\n\nResultsThere were significant differences in the distribution of dementia types across occupation groups (Chi2=85.87, p<.001). Vascular dementia was relatively common in the Transportation/Logistics sector, and higher vascular risk factors partly explained this relationship. Alzheimers disease occurred less in Transportation/Logistics and more in Health Care/Welfare occupations, which related to a higher/lower percentage of males. We found no relationships between occupational classes and clinical phenotypes of AD (Chi2=53.65, n.s.).\n\nConclusionsRelationships between occupation and dementia seem to exist beyond complexity level, which offers new opportunities for disease prevention and improvement of occupational health policy.",

      "abstract": "The modern economy is driving multiple environmental and social crises across the globe. Capital accumulation externalizes the myriad damage associated with commodity production to ecosystems, labor, public health, and governments across jurisdictions. A growing literature shows multinational agriculture, a major sector of the economy, plays a fundamental role in disrupting the ecological cycles upon which communities across the globe depend. We report here one of the first statistical tests of such an ecosocial rift. We used geometric morphometrics to characterize a parameter space in agricultural alienation across nature, human welfare, and industrial appropriation for 25 U.S. states, at five-year increments between 1970 and 2000. The first two relative warps of the analysis reproduce the long-documented shift in and out of the 1980s farming crisis. We found the crisis left the U.S. food system in a new configuration, with commodity crops replacing cropland pasture, greater farm debt load, overcapitalized inputs, and a relative decline in on-farm wages. To determine if such a shift had an epidemiological impact, we tested whether salmonellosis and shigellosis--two foodborne pathogens for which national incidence data across the study period were available--regressed against historical changes in this alienation space across geographic scale. The second relative warp for shigellosis showed a multivariate relationship with the alienation space, but significance failed to withstand a Bonferroni correction. The partial warps and Procrustes residuals of temporal trends in the alienation space likewise exhibited limited predictive capacity for outbreak size. In part these results may reflect sampling artifacts. Data availability limits both the number of years sampled and the variety of diseases tested. Nevertheless, our analyses demonstrate that metabolic rifts associated with specific modes of production can be rigorously investigated.",

      "abstract": "Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread.\n\nWe identified articles on PubMed employing simulation-based methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter-search strategies, GOF measures, and model validation.\n\nThe PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy - either an optimisation algorithm (14/40) or a sampling algorithm (26/40). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 (52%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25/44) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a minority of the included articles, 14 (17%) provided a rationale for their choice of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37%) articles.\n\nReporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures.\n\nAuthor summaryCalibration - that is, \"fitting\" the model to data - is a crucial part of using mathematical models to better forecast and control the population-level spread of infectious diseases. Evidence that the mathematical model is well-calibrated improves confidence that the model provides a realistic picture of the consequences of health policy decisions. To make informed decisions, Policymakers need information about uncertainty: i.e., what is the range of likely outcomes (rather than just a single prediction). Thus, modellers should also strive to provide accurate measurements of uncertainty, both for their model parameters and for their predictions. This systematic review provides an overview of the methods used to calibrate individual-based models (IBMs) of the spread of HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis. We found that less than half of the reviewed articles used reproducible, non-subjective calibration methods. For the remaining articles, the method could either not be identified or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method. Only one-third of the articles obtained estimates of parameter uncertainty. We conclude that the adoption of better-documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology.",

The objective of this study was to characterize eating behaviors during the first ten years of life and evaluate associations with BMI at age 11 years.\n\nMethodData were parental reports of eating behaviors from 15 months to age 10 years (n=12,048) and standardized body mass index (zBMI) at age 11 years (n=4884) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Latent class growth analysis was used to derive latent classes of over-, under-, and fussy eating. Linear regression models for zBMI at 11 years on each set of classes were fitted to assess associations with eating behavior trajectories.\n\nResultsWe identified four classes of overeating; \"low stable\" (70%), \"low transient\" (15%), \"late increasing\" (11%), and \"early increasing\" (6%). The \"early increasing\" class was associated with higher zBMI (boys: {beta}=0.83, 95%CI:0.65, 1.02; girls: {beta}=1.1; 0.92, 1.28) compared to \"low stable\". Six classes were found for undereating; \"low stable\" (25%), \"low transient\" (37%), \"low decreasing\" (21%), \"high transient\" (11%), \"high decreasing\" (4%), and \"high stable\" (2%). The latter was associated with lower zBMI (boys: {beta}=-0.79; -1.15, - 0.42; girls: {beta}=-0.76; -1.06, -0.45). Six classes were found for fussy eating; \"low stable\" (23%), \"low transient\" (15%), \"low increasing\" (28%), \"high decreasing\" (14%), \"low increasing\" (13%), \"high stable\" (8%). The \"high stable\" class was associated with lower zBMI (boys: {beta} =-0.49; -0.68 -0.30; girls: {beta} =-0.35; -0.52, -0.18).\n\nConclusionsEarly increasing overeating during childhood is associated with higher zBMI at age 11. High persistent levels of undereating and fussy eating are associated with lower zBMI. Longitudinal trajectories of eating behaviors may help identify children potentially at risk of adverse weight outcomes.",
